This is my personal website, bootstrapped by nextjs. 

The reason there are not many commits on this website, is because I needed to fix a corrupted file with the base of my file in my previous repository. Thus, I created a new nextjs project where I re-added in all my code with a non-corrupted file. This will be the new repo!
